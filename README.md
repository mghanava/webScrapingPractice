# webScrapingPractice
This is my first practice and a webpage of New Yor Times is scraped. 
The csv file contains the four categories of scraped information. 
The notebook code is exported in HTML format for better and consistent view. 
All package information (names and versions) are stored in requirements.txt file for code reproducibility.
